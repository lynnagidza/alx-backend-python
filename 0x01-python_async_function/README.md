# 0X01. Python - Async

This project focuses on working with asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio module. It involves implementing various tasks that utilize async coroutines and measure execution time.

## Tasks

### [0. The basics of async](./0-basic_async_syntax.py)

Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

Use the random module.

### [1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async](./1-concurrent_coroutines.py)

Import wait_random from the [previous python file](./0-basic_async_syntax.py) that you’ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of concurrency.

### [2. Measure the runtime](./2-measure_runtime.py)

From the [previous file](./1-concurrent_coroutines.py), import wait_n into 2-measure_runtime.py.

Create a measure_time function with integers n and max_delay as arguments that measures the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay), and returns total_time / n. Your function should return a float.

Use the time module to measure an approximate elapsed time.

### [3. Tasks](./3-tasks.py)

Import wait_random from [0-basic_async_syntax](./0-basic_async_syntax.py).

Write a function (do not create an async function, use the regular function syntax to do this) task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns a asyncio.Task.

### [4. Tasks](./4-tasks.py)

Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n except task_wait_random is being called.
